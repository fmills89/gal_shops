## Description

Built using React-Native, GLA Shops helps you keep track of what you need before heading to the store. Never go grocery shopping without a list! This is my first React Native application built without the use of a tutorial guiding me along the way. I used previous React Native experience and Udemy to help me implement features. GLA Shops is designed by me as well.

### Deployed Application

Deployed details coming soon..
